            <li>After a few minutes, add the remaining room temperature water 
                and oil and let it sit for 10 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Separately, combine the flour, salt and sugar in
                a large bowl.</li><br>
            <li>Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture 
                and combine together to create a rough
                soft ball.</li><br>
            <ul><li>Add additional water by the tsp if the dough
                does not come together into a ball</li></ul><br>
                <!--Change the wording here-->
            <li>Flour a surface for kneading, 
                and knead the dough for a few minutes. 
                Shape the dough into a ball.</li><br>
            <li>Oil (or butter up) a large bowl, and place the ball 
                of dough inside. Cover the bowl with a damp clean cloth
                and leave it somewhere warm to rise for at least
                2 hours.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <h3>Two Hours Later...</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn the oven on to 350 F and grab your pizza pans or
                even a baking tray.</li><br>
            <li>Butter up the pan or dust it with cornmeal.</li><br>
            <!--Change the wording here, and the next step-->
            <li>Take 1/2 the dough for a big pan, or 1/4-1/3
                of the dough for a small pan, and slowly stretch it out
            </li><br>
            <li>Take the dough and put it in the pan, slowly stretching 
                the dough to fit.</li><br>
            <li>Cover with a layer of sauce, cheese and your 
                chosen toppings, and bake in the oven for 
                15- 20 minutes, or until the cheese is nice and melted.
