            <ul><li><em>Skip the "Fried Shallots" Steps if You

            <li>3-4 Cloves Garlic for Frying</li><br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, saute the diced shallots in a little oil 
                until the shallots have browned slightly.</li><br>
            <li>Add palm sugar, tamarind juice, water and fish sauce
                to the shallots and let it simmer until the sugar
                is dissolved and the sauce has thickened slightly
                (<em> about 3 to 5 minutes</em>).</li><br>
            <ul><li>You can crush the sugar lumps with a wooden spoon
                while it is simmering to help the sugar dissolve
                 more quickly.</li></ul><br>
            <li>Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning as needed.</li><br>
            <ul><li><em>Note:The sauce will be mellowed out by the eggs.</em></li></ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>Fried Shallots</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the shallots thinly lengthwise,
                and put them on a plate lined with a paper
                towel.</li><br>
            <li>Sprinkle salt over the shallots and let them
                sit for 10 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>After letting the shallots sit, press a paper towel 
                onto the shallots to absorb all the liquid that has 
                been drawn out by the salt.</li><br>
            <li>Heat just enough oil in a wok or shallow pan
                to cover the shallots. Turn the heat up to
                medium high and immediately add the shallots.</li><br>
            <li>When the shallots are bubbling, turn the heat
                down to low and keep them bubbling until they
                are golden brown and cripsy.</li><br>
            <ul><li><em>Note: They burn quickly, so watch them!</em></li></ul>
            <br>
            <li>Remove the shallots with a skimmer and drain on a 
                paper towel and turn off the heat.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Garlic Chips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the Garlic Cloves Thinly</li><br>
            <li>In the same oil used for the fried shallots,
                add the sliced garlic and <strong>THEN</strong>
                turn the heat back on to low.
            </li><br>
            <li>Keep frying the garlic on low until the garlic
                has turned a light golden color and it 
                stops bubbling.</li><br>
            <li>Remove the garlic chips and drain on a paper towel.
                turn off the heat.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Fried Chillies</h3>
        <p><em>Optional</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry the dried chilies on low heat until they 
                turn a maroon color and smell smoky.</li><br>
            <li>Remove and drain on a paper towel</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Fried Eggs</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add enough oil to a pot so that it comes
            halfway up the eggs. Heat the oil on medium 
        high until the oil reaches 375-400&deg;F</li><br>
            <li>While the oil is heating up, dry the eggs 
                with a paper towel.</li><br>
                <ul><li>This will keep the oil from 
                    splattering too much</li></ul><br>
            <li>Add the eggs to the oil, one at a time, 
                and fry them until they become 
                golden brown. Flip the eggs and 
                brown the other side.
            </li><br>
            <li>Remove the eggs from the oil and drain on a 
                paper towel.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To Finish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the eggs in half with a sharp knife
                and arrange them on a plate, cut side up.
            </li><br>
            <li>Reheat the sauce, adding water if it has 
                become too thick, and then drizzle the 
                sauce over the eggs.
